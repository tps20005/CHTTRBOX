# CHTTRBOX
The following is the code used implementing our project for the CS Girlies Hackathon. 

## Inspiration
Our inspiration is our personal experience with struggling with talking to other people. My teammate and I are both socially anxious people, a common struggle we face is finding topics to talk to as our minds tend to usually go blank. This led us in creating a website that helps facilitate that struggle by having a place where you can find HUMAN generated prompts that you can use when talking to others whether that is a friend, professor, etc.  

## What it does
Users choose from a list of choices the type of person they want to talk to (e.g. professor), choose a potential topic (e.g. research), and the level of formality (e.g. professional). Once the user enters all this information they press 'Enter' and will have a list of potential talking points to use. 

## How we built it
We used Canva as a way to be able to visually "see" our vision for our website. For coding, we used both HTML and CSS. 

## Challenges we ran into
A main challenge we faced would be piecing everything together as we would face issues with HTML and CSS, where when we test out the website it wouldn't do what we wanted it to do. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being able to code a simple website especially as we're still beginners when it comes to coding something like this. 

## What we learned
We learned how to implement HTML and CSS to create a functional website. 

## What's next for CHTTRBOX
Implementing a Roleplay feature, where users are able "practice" the talking points generated along with a Tips page which provides advice on socializing with others (e.g. body language).
